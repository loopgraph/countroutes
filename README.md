The **countroutes** plugin is used in QGIS (free and open-source geographic information system) and allows users to analyze a network and build routes based on vector and raster data. 

### Currently implemented algorithms:
- **Bottleneck Quest** It enables to find 1) line sections with two endpoints connecting network circle segments, 2) blind pass branches.
